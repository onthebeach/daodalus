'Daodalus' hopes to succeed where Daedalus failed by preventing your application code from flying too close to the code that interacts with your datastore.\r\n\r\nOriginally conceived of as an implementation of the Data Access Object pattern, it has evolved since then into more of a DSL to simplify doing complicated things with Mongo. However, by separating your models from the object used to interact with their stored form, we hope Daodalus still encourages your application and data layers to keep their distance from each other.\r\n\r\n## Registering connections\r\n\r\nBefore being able to use Daodalus you will need to create and register one or more connections to your instance (or instances) of MongoDB. Here's how you do it:\r\n\r\n    conn = Mongo::MongoClient.new('localhost', 27017, pool_size: 5)\r\n    Daodalus::Connection.register(conn, :name)\r\n\r\nIf you leave off the name, the connection will be registered as `:default`.\r\n\r\nThe connection can be any MongoDB connection class provided by the Ruby Mongo Driver - so you could also use a `MongoShardedClient` or `MongoReplicaSetClient` here.\r\n\r\n## Creating a DAO\r\n\r\nCreate a DAO by specifying a database and collection (and optional connection name, defaulting to 'default'):\r\n\r\n    dao = Daodalus::DAO.new(:my_db, :my_collection, :my_connection)\r\n\r\nThe `connection` name must match one of the connections you registered earlier.\r\n\r\n## Access to MongoDB Collection Methods\r\n\r\nYou now have access to several basic MongoDB methods as defined on the `Mongo::Collection` class of the MongoDB Ruby driver. The following methods work unchanged:\r\n\r\n* `#find`\r\n* `#update`\r\n* `#insert`\r\n* `#save`\r\n* `#remove`\r\n* `#count`\r\n* `#aggregate`\r\n\r\nHowever, `#find_one` and `#find_and_modify` work slightly differently. While the original methods return either the matched document or `nil`, Daodalus is allergic to `nil`s, and so avoids them by using optional types instead. So the values returned will be either `Some[value]` or `None`. You can read more about optional types and see the implementation used by Daodalus [here](http://github.com/rsslldnphy/optional).\r\n\r\nThese are the only methods exposed by the Daodalus DAO - but should you need to call any other methods on the collection, the `Mongo::Collection` object can be accessed directly by calling `dao.coll`.\r\n\r\n## Queries\r\n\r\nQueries are built up by chaining together one or more 'where' clauses, like this:\r\n\r\n    dao.where(:name).eq('Terry').and(:paws).gte(3).find\r\n\r\nNote that a longer-form version of the clause name usually exists as an alias if you prefer to be a bit more verbose. So the above could equally be expressed as:\r\n\r\n    dao.where(:name).equals('Terry').and(:paws).greater_than_or_equal(3).find\r\n\r\nNotice the `find` at the end of the chain? This is what terminates the chain and sends your query to Mongo. You can also use `find_one` here (which, remember, will return an `Option`) as well as some other methods for updating and aggregation that we'll come to later.\r\n\r\nIf you need to make multiple assertions about the same field, you can simply chain them like this:\r\n\r\n    dao.where(:paws).gt(2).lt(5).find\r\n\r\nBut bear in mind that it's not possible to make an equality assertion *and* another assertion on the same field. (Which makes sense if you think about it.) This will raise an `InvalidQueryError`.\r\n\r\nQuerying against nested fields works just like it does in plain Mongo, using the dot operator. (You can pass field names as strings or symbols, it's up to you.)\r\n\r\n    dao.where(:'paws.2.toes').gt(3) # the third element of the paws array has a toes field that is > than 3\r\n\r\nHere is the complete list of currently implemented 'where' clauses you can use with Daodalus.\r\n\r\n| Clause     | Alias                      | Usage                         | Translation                       |\r\n| ---------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\r\n| `#eq`       | `#equals`                   | `dao.where(:paws).eq(4)`      | `{ 'paws' : 4 }`               |\r\n| `#ne`       | `#not_equal`                | `dao.where(:paws).ne(4)`      | `{ 'paws' : { '$ne' : 4 } }`   |\r\n| `#lt`       | `#less_than`                | `dao.where(:paws).lt(4)`      | `{ 'paws' : { '$lt' : 4 } }`   |\r\n| `#gt`       | `#greater_than`             | `dao.where(:paws).gt(4)`      | `{ 'paws' : { '$gt' : 4 } }`   |\r\n| `#lte`      | `#less_than_or_equal`       | `dao.where(:paws).lte(4)`     | `{ 'paws' : { '$lte' : 4 } }`  |\r\n| `#gte`      | `#greater_than_or_equal`    | `dao.where(:paws).gte(4)`     | `{ 'paws' : { '$gte' : 4 } }`  |\r\n| `#in`       | -                          | `dao.where(:paws).in(4, 3)`   | `{ 'paws' : { '$in' : [4, 3] } }`  |\r\n| `#nin`      | `#not_in`                   | `dao.where(:paws).gte(4)`     | `{ 'paws' : { '$nin' : [4, 3] } }`  |\r\n| `#all`      | -                          | `dao.where(:likes).all('tuna', 'catnip')`     | `{ 'likes' : { '$all' : ['tuna', 'catnip'] } }`  |\r\n| `#size`      | -                   | `dao.where(:likes).size(3)`     | `{ 'likes' : { '$size' : 3 } }`  |\r\n| `#exists`      | -                   | `dao.where(:tail).exists`     | `{ 'tail' : { '$exists' : true } }`  |\r\n| `#does_not_exist`      | `#exists(false)`                   | `dao.where(:tail).does_not_exist`     | `{ 'tail' : { '$exists' : false } }`  |\r\n\r\n### Logic\r\n\r\nUsing `#not` will negate the following where clause (one only), whatever it might be. So:\r\n\r\n    dao.where(:paws).not.gte(4)\r\n\r\ntranslates as:\r\n\r\n    { 'paws' : { '$not' : { '$gte' : 4 } } }\r\n\r\nThe MongoDB `or` and `nor` operators have different names in Daodalus so that they make more sense in the context they're in. So, to match *any* of a set of clauses, use `#any` like this:\r\n\r\n    dao.where.any(\r\n      dao.where(:paws).eq(3),\r\n      dao.where(:name).eq('Terry')\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    # translates as { '$or' : [ { 'paws' : 3 }, { 'name' : 'Terry' }] }\r\n\r\n...and to match only if *none* of a set of clauses match, use `#none`:\r\n\r\n    dao.where.none(\r\n      dao.where(:paws).eq(3),\r\n      dao.where(:name).eq('Terry')\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    # translates as { '$nor' : [ { 'paws' : 3 }, { 'name' : 'Terry' }] }\r\n\r\n### Matching array elements\r\n\r\nYou can also ensure a specific array element matches a number of conditions using the `#elem_match` method.\r\n\r\n    dao.where(:foods).elem_match(\r\n      dao.where(:type).eq(:wet).and(:name).eq(\"Whiskas\")\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    # translates as { 'foods' : { '$elemMatch' : { 'type' : 'wet', 'name' : 'Whiskas' } } }\r\n\r\nThis will match only documents with a `foods` array which contains an element with a `type` value of \"wet\" *and* a `name` value of \"Whiskas\".\r\n\r\n### The hard way\r\n\r\nIf you want to just pass a hash as a where clause just as you would if you were using the driver directly, you can do that too, like this:\r\n\r\n    dao.where(name: 'Terry', paws: 3)\r\n\r\nThis can be more readable for simple equality matching over a number of fields.\r\n\r\n## Selecting Fields to be Returned (Projection)\r\n\r\nYou don't always want the whole document to be returned. Mongo allows you to specify which fields you're interested in. To do this in Daodalus, use `#select`. Here's how to specify a bunch of fields to be selected:\r\n\r\n    dao.select(:name, :paws, :tail)\r\n\r\nNB. Although MongoDB *always* selects the `_id` field by default, Daodalus does not do this (in order to reduce the number of 'special cases'). If you need the `_id` field, simply specify it as part of the select.\r\n\r\n### Chaining selects\r\n\r\nIf you're selecting lots of fields, you may wish to split the statement over multiple lines - or you could wish to separate groups of selected fields for semantic reasons. To help keep this neat, selects can be chained with the `and` method like this:\r\n\r\n    dao.select(:cats, :dogs, :fish).and(:pigs, :sheep, :horseys)\r\n\r\n### The positional operator\r\n\r\nIn Mongo, if you want to select only the first matched subdocument in an array you use the positional operator (`$`). In Daodalus, we've given that the slightly more descriptive name of `#by_position`. Use it like this:\r\n\r\n    dao.select(:cats).by_position.where(:'cats.paws').gt(3) # select and return only the first cat with > 3 paws\r\n\r\nYou could also have specified the positional operator manually as part of the field name like this:\r\n\r\n    dao.select(:'cats.$').where(:'cats.paws').gt(3)\r\n\r\n### Slice\r\n\r\nTo select a subsection of an array, use `#slice`.\r\n\r\n    dao.select(:favourite_foods).slice(4)      # get the first four\r\n    dao.select(:favourite_foods).slice(-4)     # get the last four\r\n    dao.select(:favourite_foods).slice(10, 4)  # get four, starting with the 10th\r\n    dao.select(:favourite_foods).slice(-10, 4) # get four, starting with the 10th from last\r\n\r\n### Elem_match\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to use `#elem_match` as part of a select clause, in a similar way to how it's used in a where clause. This time, it makes sure that only the first element in an array that matches the provided query is returned.\r\n\r\n    dao.select(:favourite_foods).elem_match(\r\n      dao.where(:price).lte(5_00)\r\n    )\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nDaodalus is Copyright © 2012-2013 On The Beach Ltd.\r\nIt is free software, and may be redistributed under the terms specified in the LICENSE file.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
